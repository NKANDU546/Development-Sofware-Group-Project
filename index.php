                <p>Gender-based violence is a persistent issue in South Africa that results in the deaths of thousands of women every year. Below is the speech by President Cyril Ramaphosa on the Gender Based Statistics in South Africa</p>
            
                <p class="fellow">
                    My Fellow South Africans,
                    Our nation is in mourning and pain. Over the past few days, our country has been deeply traumatised by acts of extreme violence perpetrated by men against women and children. These acts of violence have made us doubt the very foundation of our democratic society, our commitment to human rights and human dignity, to equality, to peace and to justice. As we have done before in times of great difficulty and strife, this is the time to come together as a nation to confront our problems directly.
                    The nation is mourning the deaths of several women and girls who were murdered by men. We know the names of Uyinene Mrwetyana, Leighandre Jegels, Janika Mallo, Ayakha Jiyane and her three little siblings, but we also grieve for many others who have died at the hands of men. These killings have caused great pain and outrage because acts of such brutality have become all too common in our communities. Violence against women has become more than a national crisis. It is a crime against our common humanity...
